## Data currency comments
These boundaries never change.

##  Data set description
Facet is the name given to a grid of 500 metre by 800 metre rectangles
covering the entire City as well as UBC and the University Endowment Lands.
These boundaries are often used when paper maps are plotted. They are also
used for the delivery of orthophotos so that file sizes are manageable.

## Data accuracy comments
These boundaries are very accurate and have not changed.

## Attributes
Each facet is defined by the coordinates of its four corners and has a name
which is an alpha character followed by one or two digits such as M7 and O13.

## Coordinate system
DWG, SHP, TIF, Mr. SID, and ECW formatted data are projected in UTM Zone 10,
NAD83 (CSRS). KML, CSV, and XLS formatted data are in latitude and longitude
(WGS84). Not all CSV and XLS files have latitude and longitude
