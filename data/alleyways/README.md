## Data currency comments
This data in City systems is updated frequently in the normal course of
business, however priorities and resources determine how fast a change in
reality is reflected in the database. The extract on this website is updated
weekly.

##  Data set description
This package consists of several files and components as follows:

  * Non-City streets
  * One way streets
  * Public streets
  * Alleyways
  * Intersections

Street centerline and names are included. The street centerline network
includes linear street objects that reflect the approximate center of the
dedicated street right-of-way. Street names are typically displayed for each
segment of the street centerline network. The linear network is broken at the
intersection of two or more City streets or alleyways.

## Data accuracy comments

are not as precise.
