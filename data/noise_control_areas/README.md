## Data currency comments
The extract for this dataset is updated weekly. There may be no change in data
content from one week to the next because there is no change in source data.
Priorities and resources will also determine how fast a change in reality is
reflected in the database.

## None
This data set contains the boundaries of areas where noise levels are limited
by City bylaws.

## Data accuracy comments
These boundaries follow street and/or lane centrelines so their placement in
the street right of way is approximate.
