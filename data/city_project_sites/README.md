## Data currency comments
This data in City systems is updated in the normal course of business, however
priorities and resources determine how fast a change in reality is reflected
in the database. The extract on this web site is updated weekly.

##  Data set description
The City Projects layer (site- and street-based) provides information about
City initiatives, projects, development proposals, and construction and
roadwork. These include projects that are of a public interest or projects
that affect others.

## Data accuracy comments
Locations which are tied to street segments may not show the exact location of
the project.

## Attributes
