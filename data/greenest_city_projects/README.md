The data set is a list of projects that are part of the initiatives under the
Greenest City 2020 Action Plan. There are 4 categories of projects, City
projects, City Studio projects, Greenest City Fund projects and Private
projects. All projects are also categorized by one of the ten Greenest City
goals. For projects to be included they must be a substantial project located
in Vancouver, initiated since the formation of the Greenest City Action Team
(2010), and contributes to a Greenest City goal.

The dataset is maintained manually and data is provided by City departments
and external agencies.

## Data accuracy comments
Data quality issues may exist in any one of the sources or there may be some
loss of quality from data entry errors.

Considerable effort has been made to ensure there are no known errors.

Dataset includes community gardens; however, not all community gardens are
included. Only new gardens that are created since 2010 or existing gardens
that have had new plot or tree planted since 2010 are included.

Dataset includes publicly accessible electric vehicle charging stations that
are installed by the City and by private owners/businesses. City does not
maintain privately installed charging stations and does not respond to issues
regarding them. Some charging stations are funded by the City but categorized
as private project when there is a private partnership.
