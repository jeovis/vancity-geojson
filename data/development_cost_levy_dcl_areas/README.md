## Data currency comments
The extract for this dataset is updated weekly. There may be no change in data
content from one week to the next because there is no change in source data.
Priorities and resources will also determine how fast a change in reality is
reflected in the database. Development decisions should be based on the Cityâ€™s
current Bylaws.

## None
Development Cost Levies (DCLs) are fees collected from new development
requiring a Building Permit. DCLs help pay for new infrastructure and
facilities (e.g., parks, daycare, housing, engineering works) needed to
service new development. There are eight DCL By-law districts including a
Vancouver DCL By-law which applies to the entire city. Excluded from the
Vancouver DCL area are seven area-specific DCL by-law areas as well as eight
other areas from which the City has secured public benefits. For more
information on DCLs see [Information Bulletin No.
