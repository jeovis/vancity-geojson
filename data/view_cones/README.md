## Data currency comments
The extract for this dataset is updated weekly. There may be no change in data
content from one week to the next because there is no change in source data.
Priorities and resources will also determine how fast a change in reality is
reflected in the database.

## None
This data set contains the boundaries of the City’s protected view corridors.
Development heights are limited in view corridors to ensure that views are not
blocked.

These view corridors have been entered accurately, but the authoritative
