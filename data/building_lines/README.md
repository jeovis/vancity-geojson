## Data currency comments
The extract for this dataset is updated weekly. There may be no change in data
content from one week to the next because there is no change in source data.
Priorities and resources will also determine how fast a change in reality is
reflected in the database.

## None
Building lines, as described in Schedule "E" of the Zoning and Development
Bylaw, regulate building placement on affected lots to allow for potential
long-term street widening or, in some cases, preservation of open spaces.
Generally, development is prohibited within that portion of the lot covered by
the building line and additional building setbacks from the building line may
be required by the zoning specific to the lot.

## Data accuracy comments
The locations should be considered approximations of the true location.
