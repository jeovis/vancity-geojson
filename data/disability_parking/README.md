## Data currency comments
The extract for this dataset is updated weekly. There may be no change in data
content from one week to the next because there is no change in source data.
Priorities and resources will also determine how fast a change in reality is
reflected in the database.

## None
Designated disability parking zones and disability meter spaces are located in
commercial districts and high-density residential areas throughout Vancouver,
with new spaces being added every year. In deciding where to install
disability zones, we look for spaces or metered spaces that are easier for
people with disabilities to access. Any vehicle displaying a permit for people
with disabilities (a SPARC placard or recognized equivalent) may use them.
Disability zones are identified with signs displaying the universal disability
symbol and disability meters are identified with blue meter heads as well as
signs.
