## Data currency comments
This data in City systems is updated in the normal course of business, however
priorities and resources determine how fast a change in reality is reflected
in the database. The extract on this web site is updated weekly.

##  Data set description
This package contains information on traffic counts as collected by staff at
intersections and by automated counters at mid-block locations. The former
includes detailed information by lane and direction, whereas the latter
focuses on direction specifically. As such, there are two layers contained in
this package:

  * Traffic countsâ€”intersection movements
  * Traffic counts--directional

**NOTE:** At this point in time, the Directional Traffic Counts dataset only shows the locations of where directional counts have been taken. The counts themselves are forthcoming but are not available at this time. Those counts are available for viewing in VanMap. The Intersection Traffic Counts show both the locations and the actual counts. 

## Data accuracy comments
The locations are approximate, either in the intersection of two or more
streets or along a block between intersections.

## Attributes
None

## Coordinate system
DWG, SHP, TIF, Mr. SID, and ECW formatted data are projected in UTM Zone 10,
NAD83 (CSRS). KML, CSV, and XLS formatted data are in latitude and longitude
(WGS84). Not all CSV and XLS files have latitude and longitude.
