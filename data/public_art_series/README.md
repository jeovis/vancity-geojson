## Data currency comments
This data in City systems is updated in the normal course of business, however
priorities and resources determine how fast a change in reality is reflected
in the database. The extract on this web site is updated weekly.

##  Data set description
This package contains information on the location of public art in the City.
Most of the public art is individual discrete pieces, but some of the public
art is part of a series. This data set contains two layers:

  * Public art individual
  * Public art series

## Data accuracy comments
For the most part, these locations are based on address and are therefore
approximate.

## Attributes
