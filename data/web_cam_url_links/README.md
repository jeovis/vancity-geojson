# Data Dictionary: Web Cam Locations & Images

The data for web cam locations is updated from time to time in the normal
course of business, however priorities and resources determine how fast a
change in reality is reflected in the database. The extract on this website
will be updated after changes are made in VanMap.

The web cam images themselves are updated approximately every 5 minutes on
this download site.

## None
The data set includes only official publicly-available web cams focusing
mostly on traffic cameras. The data sets contain links to these cameras and we
do not control what is displayed by the cameras. The traffic cameras are also
available through Road Ahead (see link below). Some of these and other web
cams are also available through Drive BC. The alternate link below allows you
to download the actual images themselves rather than first going to the URL
and accessing them.

## None
The data set reflects the approximate locations of web cams. As the camera may
be at different places in different intersections, the locations should not be
regarded as exact. The images show what the camera sees.

DWG, SHP, TIF, Mr. SID, and ECW formatted data are projected in UTM Zone 10,
NAD83 (CSRS). KML, CSV, and XLS formatted data are projected in latitude and
longitude (WGS84). Not all CSV and XLS files have latitude and longitude and
those are not projected.

The actual images are in JPG format.
