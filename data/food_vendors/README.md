# Food Vendors
## Data custodian
Engineering Services, Streets Administration

## Data currency comments
This data is updated from time to time in the normal course of business as new
information is available, however priorities and resources determine how fast
a change in reality is reflected in this database.

## None
The data set contains location and information for street food vendors
approved in the 2010 pilot program.

## Data accuracy comments
The locations of the street vendors shown in the database are based on the
sites approved by the City. They will be very close to the exact locations but
should be considered approximate.

## Attributes
Attributes include locational information. Other attributes will be made
available as they become available.

## Coordinate system
DWG, SHP, TIF, Mr. SID, and ECW formatted data are projected in UTM Zone 10,
NAD83 (CSRS). KML, CSV, and XLS formatted data are projected in latitude and
longitude (WGS84). Not all CSV and XLS files have latitude and longitude and
those are not projected.
