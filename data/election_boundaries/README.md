## Data set description
Voting division boundaries for the cityâ€™s 2008 and 2011 municipal elections.

Prior to the 2014 municipal election, the City was divided into voting
divisions and voters were required to vote at a designated voting place within
their assigned voting division.

The City operates an at-large voting system.

Note:

  1. In 2014, voters can vote at any voting place within the city of Vancouver, eliminating the need for voting divisions.
  2. University Endowment Lands residents are not eligible to vote for Mayor, Councillors and Park Commissioners, but are eligible to vote for School Trustees at any Advance Voting place or at either of the two UEL/UBC voting places on Election Day. 

## Data accuracy comments
Division boundaries change from election to election and are not directly
comparable over time.
