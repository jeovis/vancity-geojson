# Parks data
## Data custodian
Board of Parks and Recreation

## Data currency comments
Data taken from Park Board site in July 2009. The data on this site is updated
weekly.

## Data set description
This data set provides information on the names and locations of City parks.
The data may be displayed as point features (a single point representing the
location of the park; this is unlikely to be the geometric centroid of the
park) or polygon features (a polygon or area coloured green to show the extent
of the park boundaries).

## Data accuracy comments
This data is as accurate as the data on the Parks and Recreation site.
Latitude and longitude are for a point in the park.

## Attributes
Name, address, latitude and longitude, and boundaries (boundaries are for
polygon features only)

## Coordinate system
DWG, SHP, TIF, Mr. SID, and ECW formatted data are projected in UTM Zone 10,
NAD83 (CSRS). KML, CSV, and XLS formatted data are in latitude and longitude
(WGS84). Not all CSV and XLS files have latitude and longitude
