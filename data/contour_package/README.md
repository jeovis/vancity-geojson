## Data currency comments
This dataset was created in 1999 and 2002 and reflects conditions in 1999 or
2002. This data has not changed

##  Data set description
The 1 metre contours were generated from data acquired as part of the
acquisition of orthophotos in 2002. The 2 and 10 metre contours were
interpolated from 1999 orthophotos. As such, they must be considered as
approximate rather than exact. They have not been updated since they were
created and do not reflect changes that have occurred since they were created.

## Data accuracy comments
These must be considered as approximate because they were digitized from
orthophotos rather than being created using survey techniques.

## Attributes
Attributes include type of contour (1, 2, or 10 metre) and contour elevation

## Coordinate system
DWG, SHP, TIF, Mr. SID, and ECW formatted data are projected in UTM Zone 10,
NAD83 (CSRS). KML, CSV, and XLS formatted data are in latitude and longitude
(WGS84). Not all CSV and XLS files have latitude and longitude
