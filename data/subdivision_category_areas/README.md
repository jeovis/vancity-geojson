## Data currency comments
The extract for this dataset is updated weekly. There may be no change in data
content from one week to the next because there is no change in source data.
Priorities and resources will also determine how fast a change in reality is
reflected in the database.

## None
This data set contains the boundaries of subdivision areas within the City.
These areas place restrictions on what can be done with properties.

## Data accuracy comments
These areas generally follow street centrelines and should therefore be
accurate for determining whether a parcel is impacted.
