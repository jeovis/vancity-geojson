## Data currency comments
This data in City systems is updated in the normal course of business, however
priorities and resources determine how fast a change in reality is reflected
in the database. The extract on this web site is updated weekly.

##  Data set description
This package contains information on the rates and time limits for parking
meters in the City. Information is shown at the block level rather than for
the individual meter.

## Data accuracy comments
Locations are shown for entire block faces however that does not mean that
there are parking meters along the entire block face.

## Attributes
None
