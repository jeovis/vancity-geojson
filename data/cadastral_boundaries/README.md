## Data currency comments
This data in City systems is updated frequently in the normal course of
business, however priorities and resources determine how fast a change in
reality is reflected in the database. The extract on this website is updated
weekly.

##  Data set description

  * Cadastral boundaries including lot lines, property lines and their dimensions (lengths) 
  * Easements

Much of the City's land base is created using survey accuracy however some
features are not as precise.

## Attributes
Attributes vary by feature type.

## Coordinate system
