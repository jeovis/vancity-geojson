The Property Use Inspections Branch enforces a number of bylaws. In addition,
inspectors serve on "Neighbourhood Integrated Service Teams", and also enforce
a number of other programs, such as the Secondary Suite Program. The division
has come to be a catch-all for solving community problems of many types.
Inspectors are assigned a field district and are responsible for all bylaw
enforcement in that district. In particular, the City of Vancouver is divided
into 23 Property Use Inspection Districts. Each district is unique, depending
on the type of neighbourhood and the types of issues that typically arise
there. The bylaw enforcement conducted by this branch normally results from
complaints, re-check of permit conditions, or routine observation by the
inspectors. Enforcement is carried out by the issuing of letters and orders
relating to bylaw violations, which may ultimately result in charges being
laid through the Bylaw Prosecutor’s office or "Show Cause Hearings" held
before Council. The Bylaws that the Property Use Inspectors enforce are the
following:

  * Zoning and Development Bylaw No. 3575
  * Parking Bylaw No. 6059
  * License Bylaw No. 4450
  * Standards of Maintenance Bylaw No. 5462
  * Sign Bylaw No. 4810
  * Untidy Premises Bylaw No. 4548
