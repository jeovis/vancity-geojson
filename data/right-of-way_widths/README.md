## Data currency comments
The extract for this dataset is updated weekly. There may be no change in data
content from one week to the next because there is no change in source data.
Priorities and resources will also determine how fast a change in reality is
reflected in the database.

## None
This data set contains the widths of City rights-of-way. The street right-of-
way widths are the legal, property-line-to-property-line widths of City-owned
road. Note this is NOT the physically constructed curb-to-curb distance.

## Data accuracy comments
These widths should be considered as approximate, however, they should be very
close to the true width.
