# Voting  places
## Data set name
Voting places

## Data custodian
Information Technology - GIS and CADD Services branch, City Clerk's

## Data currency comments
These are the voting places used for the Cityâ€™s municipal election during
Advance Voting and on Election Day.

## Data set description
Prior to the 2014 municipal election, the city was divided into voting
divisions and voters were required to vote at a designated voting place within
their assigned voting division.

In 2014, voters can vote at any voting place within the City of Vancouver,
eliminating the need for voting divisions.

Note:

  1. University Endowment Lands residents are not eligible to vote for Mayor, Councillors and Park Commissioners, but are eligible to vote for School Trustees at any Advance Voting place or at either of the two UEL/UBC voting places on Election Day.

The City operates an at-large voting system.

## Data accuracy comments
Voting places change from election to election and are not directly comparable
over time.
