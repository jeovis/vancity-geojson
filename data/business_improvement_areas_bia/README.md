This data in City systems is updated in the normal course of business, however
priorities and resources determine how fast a change in reality is reflected
in the database. The extract on this web site is updated weekly.

##  Data set description
The Business Improvement Area layer includes the boundary areas for the Cityâ€™s
BIAs. Business Improvement Areas or BIAs are non-profit associations of

approximate.
